						<p>
							For many people beside Apple, iOS 7 marks a major departure from what's come before. Much of the rection (in my opinion) has been very visceral and perhaps overly focused on aesthetics and stylistic choices. I will speak of aesthetics and style, but will try my best to do so in a manner that pertains directly to how these choices affect interaction and useability. Of course, I have my opinions on these matters as well, but I prefer to leave those for a separate discussion.

							One of the things I really enjoy about the iOS interface is that a sense of playfulness has been restored to both the interactions and the still graphics. The light, thin type. The "hide-and-seek" effect afforded by the layering and transparency. Icons on the iOS 7 home screen have a slightly more curved corner radius than those from the previous version. Even the circular network strength indicator and stretched battery indicator seem slightly playful in their presentation.

					<div class="post-text">
						<p>
							Apple may have removed much of the faux-leather, beveling, and imitation of real world textures that characterized their previous stock apps, but the new operating system is not without depth and character. The designers in Cupertino made extensive use of three principal effects to give the interface depth and life: translucency and blurring, the z-axis, and animations.

							Visually, much of iOS 7 is very polished, with a few notable exceptions [link to someone else talking about Reminders, et al.]. Though there are certainly a few visual glitches, however. Menu backgrounds and text don't always align; list items sometimes slip behind their headers; and the animation for opening an app - a dramatic zoom-in effect that gives an amazing impression of continuity from one screen to the next - isn't very smooth near the end. While overall I appreciate the liberal use of Helvetica Neue Light throughout the interface, the type can also be too thin and low-contrast in places (Reminders, Calendar are the worst offenders), but on the whole it's fresh and "looks digital" in a way that's substantially different than Android or Windows Phone.

						<p>
							All this talk about similarities between the visual styles of Android and iOS7 is missing the point. Do both make use of thin strokes, flat neutral-colored interface chrome, and blue as an accent color? Yes. Does this mean Apple is copying Android, as some of the more vociferous among us proclaim? Not really. It means that Apple is aware of the shift in interface design towards more mature paradigms, and is evidence of the evolution of Apple's philosophy on mobile computing. We're finally understanding, designing, and appreciating digital interface aesthetics that appeal to and amplify our humanity. Digital can be warm and inviting without mocking our ability to adapt and learn. Touch interfaces are getting to the point where they're no longer new, at least not to my generation, nor the ones preceding us who invented Digital. It is New, however, to the generation being born now. They will see considerably less of the Analogue items being referenced in the interface elements of iOS 6 and the applications designed for it. We should design for that future. Their future.
						</p>
						<p>
							Characterizing the interactions and lack of interface chrome as bringing the philosophy of the platform more inline with ideals of the 'information appliance'. It suits itself to accomplishing a multiplicity of tasks by becoming the tool itself. The manner in which you switch between apps - such as when you open a link from Mail, for example - also deserves mention because it further serves to reinforce this concept.

							It's easy to tell the difference between what they spent a lot of time polishing for the demo and everything else. Siri is broken and Background App Refresh absolutely murders my battery. I'm charging at least twice a day now: once at night, once midday, usually around 1:30, and sometimes once more before leaving the office and riding to the train. I tend to use my phone more than the average person, mainly because I'm constantly testing websites, apps, and things that I build for small screens. That being said, prior to installing iOS7 Beta 1, I could usually get a full day of use on a single charge during the night. Beside battery issues, Reminders is a hot mess, as is Notes and Stocks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Oh yeah - the parallax effect is gorgeous. However, it only took a week for me to get tired of it. Be warned: the effect can be very pronounced. You may not like it. I eventually turned it off, but then turned it on and experimented with diferent backgrounds. I eventually tried it with a dark, simple background and I like it again. So far, I've not been able to discern any noticeable effect of the feature on battery life, but this is also difficult to determine due to the pronounced effect Background App Refreshing has on the battery.
						</p>
						<p>
							Lots and lots of bugs; this is expected. App switching causes my phone to crash and restart. A lot. I'm amazed this worked so well in the demo. Switching from web clips is a no-go. It takes you to the back of the app list and any attempts to switch back promptly cause the phone to turn off and then on again. When it does work, the app switcher is a wonderful and thoroughly more useful experience. Flicking apps up and away to close the is as satisfying as it sounds (sadly, this also causes the phone to reboot more often than not). Again, the parallax effect is put to use mainly as eye candy, but it's well done nonetheless. Finally, the Portrait Orientation Lock will occasionally come on. I have no idea why this happens; it seems to be completely random.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm aware that the mobile phone OS arena constitutes a few more than just Apple, Google and Microsoft. There's RIM and BlackBerry OS; Mozilla and Firefox OS; Canonical with Ubuntu; and Samsung's Bada, among a few others. I'll definitely take a look at those at some later date. For now, I'll continue to focus on Apple and those whom I consider to be its primary competitors (Google and Microsoft).
