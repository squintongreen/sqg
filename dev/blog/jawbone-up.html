						<p>
							I bought a Jawbone UP at the beginning of May. I harbour a certain fascination with capturing the stream of data that typifies my daily life. Though we've been <em>producing</em> information since the beginning of our species, we're just now reaching a point where we can <em>capture</em> it. My interest extends far beyond myself, as I wish to explore the data streams of others. For now, however, I’m limited to studying myself. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Quantifying one's self isn't so hard as it may at first appear. While it does take a certain amount of patience and dedication, there are thankfully a number of services and products that are willing to assist. I narrowed my search down to three: the Nike Fuel Band, Jawbone UP, and FitBit Flex.<sup><a id="no1" href="#footnotes">[1]</a></sup><sup><a id="no2" href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup> Despite being one of the more expensive options, I chose the UP because of its ability to receive input from the other services that I use, such as RunKeeper and MyFitness Pal.<sup><a id="no3" href="#footnotes">[3]</a></sup> If you own a Withings Scale, you can also connect that to UP. I also wanted to be able to get my raw data back out, at my discretion. While none of the platforms offer an explicit data export mechanism, Jawbone's newly minted UP Platform allows you to capture your data using the service <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Data and platforms and all that stuff are nice, but it's nothing without the band - so let's talk hardware. Generally speaking, I prefer a simple aesthetic in my wristwear, but I like the design of the Jawbone UP. I'd almost say that the  UP wrist band is a study in functional, yet stylish, minimalism. The band flexes open and closed to retain its position on the wrist, removing altogether the familiar clasp that the Fuel band and Flex utilize. This makes the plastic on the snap-clasp of the FitBit FLex look a little cheap. Jawbone did a great job giving this product a premium look and feel. On the negative side, it's a little thick and the soft touch texture gets stuck on sleeves easily. This may be an issue if you’re not used to wearing stuff on your wrist.
						</p>
						<p>
							To sync your data, you have to plug the device into your phone via a 3.5mm headphone jack to sync. This is hardly an ideal situation, as you now have a second piece to lose (the cap) when syncing. The 99$USD FitBit Flex is able to sync via Bluetooth. I wonder why this functionality was omitted from the UP. My only guess would be to preserve battery life. Jawbone has given an estimated 10-days of operation on a full charge. I can confirm that the band does indeed last for a solid 10 days on a full charge. The last few charges have ended up being around nine days, but I suspect that this is only natural behavior for a rechargeable battery. Herein lies the other problem with devices built in this fashion. Without an independent battery, I will have to replace the entire band when the battery dies.
						</p>
						<p>
							Software wise, there are accompanying iOS and Android apps. There is no desktop website or portal, but the app is well-designed enough to help mitigate this for the time being. Though it acts as a decent enough aggregator of various data streams (RunKeeper integration, et al), it's lacking in the ability to surface relevant data and trends beyond your sleep and activity levels (steps, mostly), as well as your overall caloric intake. Much of that can be attributed to a user interface that seems unfocused. I'll go into more detail on the iPhone app in another post. In order to keep up with competition from FitBit and Basis, Jawbone will need to provide a similar web dashboard soon. There's a ton of data here, and having the space of a larger screen will afford the UP platform the opportunity to show me even greater detail about my life.

							The build quality is solid. It’s got a soft-touch finish with a ridged texture. If you own either of the Jambox speakers, you’ve seen this before.

							Push the little button on the end to change modes (pedometer, activity, sleep). A little indicator light flashes for visual confirmation, and the bracelet vibrates with a reassuring little buzz.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have $129 to spend (around $150 with shipping and tax, depending on where you live) and want a way to track your general activity level, sleep, and nutrition I would recommend the Jawbone UP. If you’re a data nut, there’s an extra incentive as you can send data to a Google Spreadsheet via <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>. This would allow you to get your hands dirty with Google's graphs and charts and possibly gain some insights into your habits. I'll be sharing the results of my own aggregation in a later post.
